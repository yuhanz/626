<h1 id="how-to-unsnag---jetty-fishing-tips">How to Unsnag - Jetty fishing tips</h1>
<p> </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Jetty fishing is fun. Fishing at jetty, however, is a challenge for a beginner fisherman. Having rocks and kelps around the jetty, snagging of lines and loss of equipment frequently happens. It would be impossible to fish without effective technique to unsnag.</p>
<p>Here are 12 tips that improve your experience at jetty fishing.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 id="use-higher-pound-fishing-line">Use Higher pound fishing line</h3>
<p>To get out of snags, it is essential to use heavier lines. 20-pound test monofilament and 30-pound test braided lines are norms. Heavier line gives a better chance to break the kelp to release it from snags.</p>
<h3 id="use-light-sinker">Use light sinker</h3>
<p>Since it is easy to lose a rig, it is better to risk losing a lighter / less expensive rig. 1 ounch sinker is a good choice and gives enough weight for casting.</p>
<h3 id="carolina-rig">Carolina Rig</h3>
<p>Carolina rig keeps the hook at the end of the line and the sinker is movable. Since hooks are more oftenly snagged, it allows you to to lose a hook instead of a sinker during a snag. As the sinker is movable, it usually doesn't get stuck.</p>
<h3 id="know-your-rock.-find-the-spots-that-snag-less">Know your rock. Find the spots that snag less</h3>
<p>After fishing at a spot for a while, you will learn how the bottom looks like through the vegetation you pulled up. Come during low tide can also help you study your fishing spot. There are plenty of space on a jetty. If a spot stuck your line many times, move on to a different spot.</p>
<p>Bringing light equipments improves your mobility, so that you can look for fish at more spots.</p>
<p>Avoid leaping on the rock to stay safe. Avoid stepping on green slippery rock as a common safety practice. Wearing gloves can prevent serious scratch on your hands when you grab on the rock in a falling accident.</p>
<h3 id="use-a-float-to-avoid-snag">Use a float to avoid snag</h3>
<p>Using a float and a dropshot can effectively avoid snags at the bottom, though it drastically reduces casting distance. A long rod can be used to accommodate the loss in casting distance.</p>
<h3 id="properly-unsnag">Properly unsnag</h3>
<p>The Bow &amp; Arrow technique is effectively at getting out of a snag. <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UR3iew9FH4g" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Fish often hides into a hole during hookup, and snags your line. Patiently give some loose line and play the bow-and-arrow technique until he swims out of the hole.</p>
<p>Try using Monofilament lines. Braid doesn't support the unsnag technique. Monofilament line has the advantage of elasticity for effective play of the bow-and-arrow technique to release from snagging into a rock.</p>
<p>One trick is to walk to the other side where the sinker has sat, and get to higher ground, which sometimes lets the snagged line get over the rock.</p>
<p>When Bow &amp; Arrow does not work, walk to the other side, and try Bow &amp; Arrow again with a different angle. Getting to higher ground works sometimes, too, as it makes the snagged line get over the rock.</p>
<h3 id="properly-break-your-line">Properly break your line</h3>
<p>When everything has failed, use the proper technique to break your line, ensuring your safety and protecting you from wearing the reel. Protect the reel by holding it from spinning. Pull without applying any force to your rod.</p>

<h3 id="fishing-at-right-weather">Fishing at right weather</h3>
<p>A successful fishing trip at Jetty is highly depending on whether the fish can get close to the rock. High wind usually brings high swell, which makes it difficult for fish to control themselves in water against hitting the rock. Fish tends to stay further under these conditions. Low wind and low swell makes perfect conditions for fish to come close. Various fish come close to the jetty looking for food during high tides. In the low tides, usually only perch and Garibaldi, who settle their home under the rock, are still around.</p>
<p>Low tide and low wind also provides angler an opportunity to reach the mussels. Fresh mussels are key bait to hook up large fish.</p>
<h3 id="keep-your-line-in-water-less-than-3-minutes">Keep your line in water less than 3 minutes</h3>
<p>Wave washes your line and moves the sinker across kelps, and eventually gets you into a snag. It is better to reel back in on the top of water before a snag happens.</p>
<h3 id="cast-straight-ahead">Cast straight ahead</h3>
<p>Always avoid to cast parallel to the jetty. Wave pushes your line toward the rocks and kelps. You line covers less area to be snagged when it is cast straight ahead.</p>
<h3 id="cast-further">Cast further</h3>
<p>There are more kelps growing close to jetty. So casting further usually helps.</p>
